To add a new language:

1. Add entry in src/unizone.pro
2. Run 'lupdate unizone.pro'
3. Run 'linguist unizone_xx.ts', where xx is the two letter language code

NOTE:   You need to check "Finished" in each entry that you want Unizone to use and
        remember to select "File - Release" too so it writes the final translation file.
